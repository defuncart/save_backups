## Releases

The latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/defuncart/game_saves_backup/releases/latest). 

In desktop mode, the application can be added to Steam Launcher as a Non-Steam game via content menu, Lutris or Heroic.

### Building from Source

In desktop mode, the application can be added to Steam Launcher as a Non-Steam game via content menu, Lutris or Heroic. Official artwork assets can be found in [assets_dev/steam](assets_dev/steam) and added via Steam launcher.

## Building Locally

If you wish to build from source, you will require:

- Flutter >= 3.16
- Dart >= 3.2
- linux:
    - clang
    - ninja-build
    - libgtk-3-dev
    - libblkid-dev

The application has not been tested on windows, however it *shouldâ„¢* theoretically work. To generate relevant flutter project files, firstly run `fvm flutter create . --platforms=macos,windows`.

## Motivation

I've encountered some issues in which saves for a particular game via emulation are corrupted, or when upgrading proton version for a Heroic prefix, the save data is lost. The goal of this project is to provide a easy way to backup your most important game saves easily. As this is a personal project, currently there is no roadmap, however new features may be developed when deemed required.

## Notes

- The backup items database is stored at `/home/deck/Documents/game_saves_backup`. Do not delete any files in this folder.

## Known Issues

- On Steam Deck Desktop Mode, 'open' game save folder does not work
- On Steam Deck Desktop Mode, back up folder opens to `/home/deck`, even though real path is saved (i.e. `/home/deck/desktop`).
